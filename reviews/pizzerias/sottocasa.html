          <h3 class="mb-2 text-tan">Mi casa, tu casa, Sottocasa</h3>
          <p>I recently had the pleasure of dining at Sottocasa, a cozy pizzeria located in the heart of Harlem, New
            York. As a self-proclaimed pizza lover, I was excited to try their wood-fired Neapolitan-style pies, and I
            must say that I was not disappointed.</p>
          <p>To start off, I ordered the burrata appetizer which was served with grilled bread, cherry tomatoes, and
            basil. The burrata was creamy and rich, and paired perfectly with the fresh and flavorful tomatoes. The
            grilled bread added a nice crunch to the dish, and the basil brought a fragrant and herbaceous note to the
            plate.</p>
          <p>For my main dish, I ordered the classic Margherita pizza, which was cooked to perfection in the
            wood-fired oven. The crust was thin and crispy with a perfectly charred edge, and the tomato sauce was
            bright and tangy. The mozzarella cheese was fresh and melted beautifully, and the basil added a refreshing
            and aromatic touch to the pie.</p>
          <p>I also tried the Diavola pizza, which had a spicy kick from the pepperoni and chili flakes, and was
            equally delicious. The toppings were fresh and of high quality, and the pizzas were served piping hot,
            straight out of the oven.</p>
          <p>To accompany my meal, I ordered a glass of red wine, which paired nicely with the pizzas and added a nice
            balance to the flavors.</p>
          <p>The service at Sottocasa was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with warm
            lighting and a rustic decor.</p>
          <p>Overall, I would highly recommend Sottocasa to any pizza lover looking for a delicious and authentic
            Neapolitan-style pie in Harlem. The quality of the ingredients and the wood-fired cooking technique make
            for a truly exceptional dining experience.</p>
