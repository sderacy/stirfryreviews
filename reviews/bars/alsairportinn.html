          <h3 class="mb-2 text-tan">Hidden Ewing Delight </h3>
          <p>I recently visited Al&#39;s Airport Inn Bar &amp; Grill in Ewing, New Jersey and was thoroughly impressed
            by both the atmosphere and the food. This dive bar offers a laid-back and welcoming environment that makes
            it a great spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat.</p>
          <p>The menu at Al&#39;s Airport Inn Bar &amp; Grill features classic bar food such as burgers, sandwiches,
            wings, and more. I opted for the classic cheeseburger with a side of onion rings, and I have to say, it
            was one of the best burgers I&#39;ve had in a while. The patty was cooked to perfection and was juicy and
            flavorful, and the toppings were fresh and added the perfect amount of crunch and flavor. The onion rings
            were also fantastic, with a crispy coating and a sweet, caramelized onion flavor.</p>
          <p>In addition to the burger and onion rings, I also tried the chicken wings, which were cooked to
            perfection and had just the right amount of spice. The wings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the
            inside, and the accompanying blue cheese sauce was the perfect complement.</p>
          <p>The drink menu at Al&#39;s Airport Inn Bar &amp; Grill is also impressive, with a wide range of options
            to suit different preferences. The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, and they made sure that my
            drinks were always topped up and to my liking.</p>
          <p>One thing that stood out to me was the friendly and welcoming service. The staff were attentive and
            accommodating, and they made sure that I had everything I needed throughout my visit.</p>
          <p>The atmosphere at Al&#39;s Airport Inn Bar &amp; Grill is casual and laid-back, with plenty of seating
            options to suit different preferences. Whether you want to sit at the bar or at a table, there is plenty
            of space to relax and enjoy your food and drinks.</p>
          <p>Overall, I would highly recommend Al&#39;s Airport Inn Bar &amp; Grill to anyone looking for a great dive
            bar with delicious food and friendly service. Whether you&#39;re in the mood for classic bar food or
            something with a twist, you&#39;re sure to find something that you&#39;ll love at this Ewing, New Jersey
            spot.</p>
