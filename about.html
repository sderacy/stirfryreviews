        <h2> Food Personality </h2>
        <p class="pr-2">I've been reviewing food for about 2 years now. What started as an obligatory review on behalf
          of Google turned into a way to share the food that I've had with others! I don't earn any money from doing
          this and I do this purely for fun. However, if you do want to rent my tastebuds for an afternoon or two, I'd
          be happy to check any places recommended! The only warning I'll give is that I am going to be brutally
          honest
          on how I feel about the food.</p>
        <h2> Fullstack Developer </h2>
        <p class="pr-2">Food reviewer by day, professional programmer by night. While I do enjoy trying new foods from
          time to time, I will say that my primary passion is Computer Science. I graduated from TCNJ with a
          Bachelor's
          Degree in Science. I was a Computer Science major and I graduated with the highest honors. I've been working
          with websites since sophomore year of high school so I've been able to witness a lot of positive changes
          especially in the realm of accessibility. While I am currently employed at Amazon Web Services as a
          Front-end
          Engineer, I am always eager to make an impact through the use of code! Download my resume where you can
          connect with me and reach out for business inquiries!</p>
